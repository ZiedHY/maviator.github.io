My name is Mohtadi Ben Fraj. I want to be a great data scientist. I created this blog to document the things that I learn in my journey. My initial contact with the field was through two internships during my bachelors degree where I worked on computer vision projects. Then I got the chance to dig further in the field with a Masters degree in computer science. I worked on some cool projects involving Twitter sentiment analysis, Amazon products recommendation engine and a pedestrian detection and activity recognition system. I enjoy working with Python, had some experience with C++ and always ready to learn new languages and tools if the task requires, after all code is just a way to express ideas. I also speak English and French fluently.

On a personal level, I enjoy playing football (soccer), hiking outdoor and weight lifting. I also enjoy traveling. I have been to 15 states in the USA and 6 other countries. My reading interests vary from time to time, currently, I am interested in personalized nutrition.

Below is a more detailed version of my education, experience and cool stuff that I have been involved with.

## Education

### Masters of Computer Science at Colorado State University 2015 - 2017

I was selected for a [Fulbright Scholarship](https://www.cies.org/about-us/what-fulbright) to study at Colorado State University. My focus was to take all possible computer graphics and computer vision courses. I ended up also taking machine learning, big data and software analysis and testing.

### Bachelors of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Tunisia Polytechnic School 2012 - 2015

For the first 3 semesters for my bachelors degree, I had courses in multiple domains (math, economics, signal processing, quantum physics, ...). After that, 3 semesters of computer science and computer engineering courses (algorithms, object oriented programming, robotics, ...).

### Associates Degree in Mathematics at Preparatory Institute for Engineering Studies of Tunis 2010 - 2012

After having the best GPA in my high school, I decided to study Mathematics to prepare for engineering schools. I had two years of advanced courses in Calculus, Algebra, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. At the end of the two years, I passed the engineering schools entrance program and was ranked 50 on 1900 students.

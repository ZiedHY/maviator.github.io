I have recently finished Grad school at Colorado State University with a Master in Computer Science. I developed an interest in Machine learning and Data science through multiple courses that I took. Wanting to get better in the field, I am setting this new goal of getting to Master tier level on Kaggle.
For people who are not familiar with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it’s a platform where data scientists, machine learning engineers, statisticians (or anyone who’s interested in data) compete in challenging machine learning competitions derived from real world problems.

## The Goal

My current tier in kaggle is Contributor, that's 2 levels from Master tier. To get there, according to [Kaggle's ranking system](https://www.kaggle.com/progression/), this is what I have to accomplish:
- Get 2 bronze medals: be in the Top 40% for small competitions (<= 249 Teams) or Top 100 for medium sized competitions (250 - 999 Teams) or Top 10% for large competitions (1000+ Teams).
- Get 2 silver medals: be in the Top 20% for small competitions or Top 50 for medium sized competitions or Top 5% for large competitions.
- Get 1 gold medal: be in top 10% for very small competitions ( <= 99 Teams) or Top 10 in medium to large competitions or (Top 10 + 0.2% Teams).

## The Metric

Given that it is clear what I need to do to get to higher tiers, these parameters will be tracked monthly:
- Number of bronze medals
- Number of silver medals
- Number of gold medals
- Rank in each competition that I participate in

## The Process

The process is simple: Participate in as many competitions as possible and get better and better ranks. I would imagine this will also include learning field tricks and learning from winning solutions for past competitions. I will also be writing a monthly post where I will update on the metrics and discuss the things that I learned from the competitions that I participated in during that month. These posts will be public on this blog. Also, all of my code and notebooks will be available on my [Github](https://github.com/maviator)
